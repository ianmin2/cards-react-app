Non-blocking fork effects​
Contributor @slorber mentioned in issue#760 several other common root implementations. To start, there is one popular implementation that behaves similarly to the tutorial root saga behavior:

export default function* rootSaga() {
  yield fork(saga1)
  yield fork(saga2)
  yield fork(saga3)
  // code after fork-effect
}
